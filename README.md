# Resources on machine learning and deep learning 

There is no doubt that Machine learning has become one of the hotest topics in computer science these days.Alot of industries has started to use it in their products , as a result there is alot of job opportunities in this field.Also,many universities are doing research on machine learning and data science and there are open positions for students who have experience in Machine Learning.With that being said,clearly having a knowledge of ML can benefit you in a lot of ways.

I've seen that alot of people don't know where to start with ML,So I decided to gather a list of best resources on machine learning and deep learning from around the web.Surely there are enormous number of good tutorials out there but I found the ones here more helpful than the rest ,they help you grasp the concepts in a small amount of time.It is worth mentioning that all the video tutorials suggested here are free.

I suggest using first 2 tutorials on each step before moving to next one.
